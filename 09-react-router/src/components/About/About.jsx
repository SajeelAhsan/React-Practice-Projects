Hi there! I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer and DevOps Engineer with a knack for crafting scalable, efficient, and user-friendly solutions.

With expertise in both front-end and back-end development, I create seamless web applications that look great and perform even better. My skills span across frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue on the front-end, and Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), and Java on the back-end.

As a DevOps enthusiast, I thrive on streamlining workflows and enhancing deployment pipelines. I have hands-on experience with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and AWS, ensuring smooth CI/CD processes and high-availability architectures.

End-to-end development of robust, responsive web applications.
Deployment and infrastructure automation with cutting-edge DevOps tools.
Problem-solving mindset to tackle complex challenges.
A collaborative approach to teamwork and a commitment to delivering high-quality solutions.
